# Asynchronous IO

提起Python3我第一个反应就是这个新增的功能， 在3.4引入标准库后被大家广泛推荐使用。
所以我就从这个包的整理学习开始吧。

My first response to mentioning Python3 is this new feature, which was widely 
recommended after introducing into the standard library in 3.4 version
So I think I should start to relearning with this package.

异步对于Python来说很重要，原因在于GIL机制。Python没有真正意义上的多线程，更多时候我们需要异步架构来实现高效处理

Asynchrony is very important in Python, because of GIL mechanism. There is no ture multithreading in Python,
we need to use asynchronous architecture for efficient processing in most of time.
